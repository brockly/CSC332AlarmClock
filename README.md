# CSC332Timer
### By: Alex Brockman, Carlos Samaniego, Juleo Amosah
In this project we use a Raspberry Pi and an AIY Voice Kit in order to create our own timer that turns off when we answer two different math questions. The project is a work in progress and we plan to add it to the future Wake Forest Ubiquitous Computing space.
